For Styling this react app i used TailwindCSS which i first had to incoorporate into the project before i use it.
And i also used few bacis CSS styling methods like external CSS and in-line CSS
i used Blue as the theme of the react app, so that the UI looks user appeling


In this react app i am using Voiceflow/react-chat package for the pre-written components.
this package gives alot of things out of the box like a Card, Message, Header, Avatar, Launcher, ChatInput, and much more.
These compoents helps in applying different functionality which saves alot of time of the developer like. ChatInput component comes with a send button embedded inside the input field and is only visible when there is some text written in the field, which is a great functionality.
Also to triger a function on some interaction which the package component there is an action prop defined for most of the components with the help of which we can add some event to the component and handle it with a function, which i have done in this react app as well.
